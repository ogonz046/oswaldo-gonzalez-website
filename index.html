        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Oswaldo Gonzalez-Ornelas, and I am a first-year, college student at the University of California, Riverside. I am also a first generation college student. I completed high school at West Campus, a public school in the city of Sacramento, which is ranked number 32 in California, and 243 nationally. My cumulative GPA in high school was 3.67, and so far, I have exceeded that number in my first quarter of college. I plan to enroll in the honors program as a second-year college student, as I received an invitation from the program due to my first-quarter GPA. I am fluent in both English and Spanish, I know the basics of French, and I am currently learning Japanese. In addition, I hold the seal of biliteracy for Spanish.
 <br><br>

        At age 17, I got my first job as a waiter at an Asian cuisine restaurant, Bento Box, in Sacramento. During my employment there, I learned many great skills such as excellent customer service, sharp time-management skills, a strict work ethic, and budget management. Although it was merely a summer job, I was regarded as one of the most skilled and prompt workers, even by workers who had achieved tenure. Furthermore, during my senior year of high school, I was part of the Youth Tobacco Advisory Committee (YTAC), which conducted research on tobacco products and their marketing strategies within the city of Sacramento, as well as provide counseling to various high schools about the dangers of these products. Working with this research team not only opened my eyes to what research actually is, but strengthened my cooperative skillset. Last but certainly not least, I have been a part of the Menâ€™s Leadership Academy (MLA) program for 3 years, since my Junior year of high school, though I am now considered an alumni of the program. The program advocates for social justice, but more importantly holds an overarching theme of advocating for the youth and leading youth, as youth, to success. While in the program, we were tasked to lead several workshops for the Boys and Men of Color (BMOC) Summit, and as a group made videos regarding social issues, such as the Standing Rock pipeline in North Dakota. One of my highlights of being in the program was our trip to Atlanta, GA in the Spring of 2018, for the annual Student African American Brotherhood (SAAB) conference. During this conference, I learned many things such as the importance of mental health and the power of healing, but the most useful and important thing I learned was the importance (and the how to) of networking. <br><br>

        Building a network, especially in the fields of business and economics, is key to success. I became interested in the field of business because of my acquired skill of networking with ease, but decided to merge that idea with economics. I have been strongly suited in the field of math, so combining two things I flow with easily seemed like a no-brainer. I am equipped with an arsenal of critical thinking and social skills, and I am most definitely ready to apply them in a new workspace.
